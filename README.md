# clerkshipApp


Description
- The OBGYN Clerkship App is a mobile application designed to support medical students, preceptors, and administrators during OBGYN clerkships. The app provides role-specific functionality to enhance learning, streamline evaluations, and manage clinical resources.


Running the app:
- The app should be run through the simulator, or downloaded onto an iPhone. Due to the extensive use of Firebase for much of the app's information, running it in the preview would exclude much of the app's functionality.
- Run on iOS 18.5 or above for the best app experience.


Key Features:
- Student View: Access clinical resources, evaluations, orientation details, and graded evaluations.
- Preceptor View: Complete and submit student evaluation forms.
- Admin View: Add and update resources, manage user accounts and permissions, and access compiled evaluation forms.
- Authentication: Secure login and account creation for students, preceptors, and administrators.
- Navigation: Role-specific home screens and bottom navigation for quick access to profiles, resources, and evaluations.


Dependencies:
- Firebase


Usage
- Sign Up / Sign In: Users create an account using their UVM email.
- Student View: Access resources, clerkship requirements, orientation info, locations, quick facts, and question-of-the-day.
- Preceptor View: Search for students and complete evaluation forms.
- Admin View: Add/edit resources and question of the day, manage user roles, and view completed evaluation forms.
